## Hi there üëã

Welcome to the GitHub org for the UTDallas subreddit: [r/utdallas](https://reddit.com/r/utdallas)!

We host all of our open source material for managing the subreddit here in this GitHub Org.


------------


A key tenant for the UTDallas subreddit is freedom of speech, transparancy, and accountability. For these reasons we have [open sourced our automod config file](https://github.com/r-UTDallas/autoMod) and working toward open sourcing our entire moderator audit log.

Reddit automod is a way for moderators to programatically define rules for removing posts, removing comments, adding flair, banning users, and much more. It is important to **"open source the algorithm"** for such a tool!

üôã‚Äç  If you have suggestions or questions for what else we should open source - let us know by posting to the subreddit!

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
